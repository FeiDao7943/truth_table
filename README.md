# Just an easy script based on python for calculating truth_table
* Enter the expression of tne circuit function after row 380
* 1.Ignore the red-highlight warning, variables' references produced during the running process
* 2.The '_'behind the digit means the 'not'
* 3.The digits follow the name of gates should increase gradually
  > e.g. `and12_3`, but not `and13_2`
* 4.Not more than 3 digits behind the name of gate, if beyond
        it is possible to combine with functions of gate
* 5.Not more than 4 variables plug in function of gate, if beyond
        it is possible to combine with functions of gate
* 6.Use variable 'f' to return the final output
* 7.The variable of function 'main' in rwp 395 means the number of total variables
        remember change the correct number just in 2, 3 or 4 before runing
* The example of problem in `e.g.png`
